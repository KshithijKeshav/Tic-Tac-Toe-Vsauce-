Super Tic Tac Toe is a strategic board game that extends the traditional Tic Tac Toe into a larger grid composed of nine smaller 3x3 grids.
The game retains the objective of getting three of your symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, either horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally, but introduces additional rules regarding gameplay within the larger grid.

Here are the rules of Super Tic Tac Toe:

1]Grid Structure: The game is played on a larger grid composed of nine smaller 3x3 grids.
Each of these smaller grids functions as a space on the larger grid.

2]Turn Alternation: Players take turns placing their symbols ("X" for one player, "O" for the other) on the larger grid.

3]Starting Move: The first player (usually determined by a coin toss or other random method) can place their symbol in any of the nine smaller grids on the larger grid.

4]Subsequent Moves: After the initial move, subsequent moves must be placed in the smaller grid corresponding to the location of the previous move. For example, if the previous move was placed in the top right corner of a smaller grid, the next player must place their move in the top right corner of the larger grid.

5]Forced Grids: If the next move corresponds to a smaller grid that has already been won or filled, the player can choose to place their symbol in any open square on the larger grid.

6]Winning Conditions: The objective is to get three of your symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) within any of the smaller grids on the larger grid. Once a player achieves this in a smaller grid, they win that grid.

7]Winning the Game: The game is won by getting three smaller grids in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the larger grid.
Once a player achieves this, they win the game.

8]Draw: If all smaller grids are filled without any player achieving a winning combination, the game is a draw.
